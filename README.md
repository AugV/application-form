# Application form

## What's this?
It's a stepper type form for client's business to provide company data and contact data.

## How do I run it locally?
1) use your preferred terminal to go to the root directory of this project
2) run `npm install` (only needed once, unless you modify deps or upgrade versions)
3) run `npm start` and watch it spin on localhost:3000

## Tech stack
1) React for DOM manipulation
2) Typescript for typesafety
3) SCSS modules for capable styling syntax and scoped styles
4) Jest (with friends) for unit testing

App is generated using CRA, so all the configuration is in [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/react-scripts)

## Scripts
`npm start` - to launch local dev server and serve the app
`npm test` - to launch unit tests
`npm build` - bundle stuff for production
`npm eject` - if we need to get our hands on webpack, babel configs. One way ticket.
